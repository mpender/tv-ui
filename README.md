Simple app to help provide actions for my Sony TV 


Add your TV IP and API KEY to a .env file (Read the .env_sample for inspiration)

## Notes
'Set Volume To Low' is set to 4 but its changeable to whatever you want
'Switch to Xbox' merely changes the input to HDMI4 (Best option for 120hz Games Consoles)
